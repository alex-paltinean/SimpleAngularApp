# SimpleAngularApp

This is a basic app which consumes an API which serves some operations on a Project Collection.

We have a few challenges for you:
1. In project details add a button to delete the project
2. In project details have a link to a new page 'tasks details' which displays the Tasks inside a Project
3. Add a button to delete a task
4. Add a button which opens a form to add a task to a project
